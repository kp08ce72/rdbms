2. Create a procedure called "update_salary" that takes an employee ID and a new salary as input and updates the employee's salary. The procedure should also log the update in a separate table called "salary_history"


3. Create a package called "Employee_Management" that contains a procedure called "promote_employee". The procedure should take an employee ID and a new job title as input and update the employee's job title. The procedure should also log the promotion in the "salary_history" table
